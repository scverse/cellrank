# AGENTS.md — CellRank

CellRank analyzes cellular dynamics from single-cell data by modeling cells as states in a Markov chain: kernels turn biological signals (RNA velocity, pseudotime, real time + OT, etc.) into cell-cell transition matrices, and estimators analyze those matrices to find initial and terminal states and compute fate probabilities.
Key frameworks: AnnData/Scanpy, numpy/scipy, [pygpcca](https://github.com/msmdev/pyGPCCA) (macrostates), optional moscot/scvelo/jax/petsc/slepc/rpy2.

## Trust Order

When sources disagree:
1. PR description and changed code
2. This file (`AGENTS.md`)
3. `REVIEW_GUIDE.md`
4. Tests and fixtures
5. Public docs in `docs/`

Every fact should have one owner. This file owns invariants and the reference table below — everything else is a pointer.

## Module Map

Two layers: **kernels** build transition matrices, **estimators** analyze them. Pointers only — class behavior lives in docstrings, design rationale in `docs/about/index.md`.

| Module | What lives there |
|--------|------------------|
| `src/cellrank/kernels/` | Layer 1 — a kernel turns one biological signal into a transition matrix. `VelocityKernel`, `PseudotimeKernel`, `CytoTRACEKernel`, `ConnectivityKernel`, `RealTimeKernel`, `PrecomputedKernel`; base classes + composition in `_base_kernel.py`. |
| `src/cellrank/estimators/` | Layer 2 — an estimator analyzes a transition matrix. `GPCCA` (recommended) and `CFLARE` under `terminal_states/`; spectral/fate logic in `mixins/`. |
| `src/cellrank/models/` | Gene-trend models fit along lineages (`prepare` → `fit` → `predict`): `GAM`, `GAMR`, `SKLearnModel`. |
| `src/cellrank/pl/` | Plotting: `circular_projection`, `gene_trends`, `heatmap`, `cluster_trends`, `log_odds`, `aggregate_fate_probabilities`. |
| `src/cellrank/datasets.py` | Example datasets (downloaded on demand). |
| `src/cellrank/_utils/` | Core utilities: `Lineage` (`_lineage.py`), AnnData key naming (`_key.py`), linear solvers (`_linear_solver.py`), optional-import guards (`_import_utils.py`). |

**Typical flow:** build a kernel → `kernel.compute_transition_matrix()` → optionally compose (`0.8 * vk + 0.2 * ck`) → `GPCCA(kernel)` → `compute_schur()` → `compute_macrostates()` → `predict_terminal_states()` (or `set_terminal_states()`) → `compute_fate_probabilities()` → `compute_lineage_drivers()`.

## Review Guidelines

For GitHub PR reviews, use `REVIEW_GUIDE.md` as the canonical review workflow and
source of review-specific risk areas, testing checks, and documentation-impact checks.
This file only owns the project invariants and source-of-truth map below.

## Critical Invariants

- **Kernel composition arithmetic.** `+` normalizes weights to sum to 1; `*` is element-wise. Composition builds an expression tree (`KernelAdd`, `KernelMul`, `Constant` in `src/cellrank/kernels/_base_kernel.py`). Changes here can silently shift transition matrices.
- **Bidirectional kernels.** `~kernel` flips direction (forward ↔ backward) on bidirectional kernels only (runtime state is the `_backward` flag); direction is encoded in `fwd`/`bwd` AnnData key suffixes via `src/cellrank/_utils/_key.py`.
- **AnnData serialization contract.** Kernels round-trip through `write_to_adata()` / `from_adata()`. Estimators maintain a shadow AnnData exposed via `to_adata()`. This is the stable boundary for saved analyses — high risk to change.
- **GPCCA delegates to [pygpcca](https://github.com/msmdev/pyGPCCA).** Schur decomposition and macrostate rotation live upstream; don't reimplement in-repo.
- **`Lineage`** (`src/cellrank/_utils/_lineage.py`) is a numpy ndarray subclass with named columns and colors. Slicing and aggregation semantics are public API.
- **AnnData key naming** goes through `src/cellrank/_utils/_key.py`. Don't hand-roll key strings.
- **Logging.** `logging.getLogger(__name__)` with lazy `%` formatting — never f-strings in logger calls.
- **Public API surface** = symbols re-exported from `src/cellrank/__init__.py` and the `cellrank.kernels` / `estimators` / `models` / `pl` / `datasets` namespaces. New top-level re-exports commit the project to an API.
- **Optional dependencies** are pip extras: `jax`, `moscot`, `petsc`, `plot`, `r`, `scvelo`. Imports must be guarded and fail with a clear message when the extra is missing.
- **Test layout is flat.** `tests/test_X.py` keyed by component, not a mirror of `src/cellrank/X/`.

## Development Commands

Python 3.12 and 3.14.

```bash
hatch test                        # run tests (default matrix)
hatch test --all                  # full Python matrix
hatch run docs:build              # build Sphinx docs
hatch run docs:open               # open built docs
pre-commit run --all-files        # lint and format
```

Focused runs:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_kernels.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_gpcca.py -v
```

PETSc/SLEPc tests are skipped unless the `petsc` extra is installed (requires a working MPI + PETSc/SLEPc build); some R-backed model tests are skipped unless `rpy2` + R's `mgcv` are available. These skips are expected **locally**, but they are **not** a CI coverage gap: alongside the main `hatch-test` matrix (which skips them), a dedicated `PETSc / SLEPc + R` job in `.github/workflows/test.yaml` installs these stacks and runs the otherwise-skipped tests. Before assuming a skip means "untested in CI", check what that workflow actually installs — the `test` dependency group in `pyproject.toml` is only part of the picture.
