**CellRank** {cite}`lange:22,weiler:24` is a modular framework to study cellular dynamics based on Markov state modeling of
multi-view single-cell data. See {doc}`about CellRank <about/index>` to learn more and {doc}`our citation guide <about/cite>` for guidance on
citing our work correctly. Two peer-reviewed publications accompany our software:

- [CellRank for directed single-cell fate mapping](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01346-6)
- [CellRank 2: unified fate mapping in multiview single-cell data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02303-9)

:::{important}
Please refer to {doc}`our citation guide <about/cite>` to cite our software correctly.
:::

CellRank scales to large cell numbers, is fully compatible with the [scverse] ecosystem, and is easy to use. In the
backend, it is powered by the [pyGPCCA package](https://github.com/msmdev/pyGPCCA) {cite}`reuter:19,reuter:22`. Feel
free to open an [issue] if you encounter a bug, need our help or just want to make a comment/suggestion.

:::{important}
If you're moving from CellRank 1 to CellRank 2, check out {doc}`../about/version2`.
:::

## CellRank's key applications

- Estimate differentiation direction based on a varied number of biological priors, including
  {doc}`pseudotime <notebooks/tutorials/kernels/300_pseudotime>`,
  {doc}`developmental potential <notebooks/tutorials/kernels/400_cytotrace>`,
  {doc}`RNA velocity <notebooks/tutorials/kernels/200_rna_velocity>`,
  {doc}`experimental time points <notebooks/tutorials/kernels/500_real_time>`, and {mod}`more <cellrank.kernels>`.
- Compute initial, terminal and intermediate {doc}`macrostates <notebooks/tutorials/estimators/600_initial_terminal>`
  {cite}`reuter:19,reuter:22`.
- Infer {doc}`fate probabilities and driver genes <notebooks/tutorials/estimators/700_fate_probabilities>`.
- Visualize and cluster {doc}`gene expression trends <notebooks/tutorials/estimators/800_gene_trends>`.
- ... and much more, check out our {doc}`API <api/index>`.

## Getting started with CellRank

We have {doc}`notebooks/tutorials/index` to help you getting started. To see CellRank in action, explore our
manuscripts {cite}`lange:22,weiler:24` in Nature Methods.
